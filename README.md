# Pack Up

Pack up your loots and use them when you need!

When you open the loot box, press X to store all the items in your loot storage.
When you need them, press P to open your loot storage, and you can take out your loot as it is.
Note that you cannot manually add items to the loot storage, and each loot box can only transfer items once.
